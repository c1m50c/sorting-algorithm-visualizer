# **algorithms**
Module for the Sorting Algorithms to be visualized while sorting.

## **Documentation**
The `docstring` for each algorithm should contain at least the time complexities as well as the space complexity for the algorithm. An example of a proper `docstring` is shown below.

```py
"""
    ## Complexities:
    ```py
    Worst Case Time Complexity == O(n * n)
    Average Case Time Complexity == O(n * n)
    Best Case Time Complexity == O(n * n)
    Space Complexity == O(1)
    ```
